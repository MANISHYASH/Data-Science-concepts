# Linear Regression Models: Practice and Solutions

## Overview
This repository is a hands-on learning resource for understanding and applying linear regression models in machine learning. It provides well-documented datasets, Jupyter notebooks, and solutions to help you build and evaluate machine learning models.

## Contents
1. **Datasets**:
   - `homeprices.csv`: A simple dataset to understand linear regression with one variable.
   - Practice datasets for hands-on exercises.
   - A dataset for building a two-variable machine learning model for home price prediction.

2. **Jupyter Notebooks**:
   - **Linear Regression (One Variable)**: A notebook that demonstrates training a model using a single independent variable, with step-by-step explanations.
   - **Linear Regression (Two Variables)**: A notebook showcasing how to expand the model with an additional variable for better prediction accuracy.

3. **Practice Section**:
   - Includes additional datasets and exercises for you to try out the concepts independently.
   - Pre-solved solutions to guide you through the learning process.
